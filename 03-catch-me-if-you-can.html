                <p class="post">Catch Me If You Can (2002) is a Steven Spielberg movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, and Amy Adams, and Martin Sheen about Frank Abagnale, Jr. (DiCaprio) conning his way as a co-pilot for PanAm, a doctor, and a lawyer, – all before his 18th birthday. A master of deception, he was also a brilliant forger, whose skill gave him his first real claim to fame: At the age of 17, Frank Abagnale, Jr. became the most successful bank robber in the history of the U.S. FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks) makes it his prime mission to capture Frank and bring him to justice, but Frank is always one step ahead of him.<br><br>Set in New York in the 60s, the film had aspects of both the domestic side of mid-century design as well as the larger-scale pieces such as the futuristic TWA Terminal in New York’s LaGuardia Airport. For example, the interior of the New York apartment the Abagnales move into features floral wallpaper and ornate wall sconces with an adorable yellow-themed kitchen.<br><br>Other places featured in the film, including the Tropicana Motel, the laundromat, the diner, Frank’s Atlanta apartment, and the multiple airports all are great examples of the more modern side of mid-century design. In Frank’s Atlanta apartment, there are many instances of the trendiest pieces of mid-century design at the time. Pieces included a lamp inspired by Robert Sonneman’s 1960s floor lamp, Italian designed wall decor, and Danish teak sideboards.<br><br>Not only was the film visually stunning, but the title sequence was a beautiful interpretation of some of the features of 1960s graphics and was extremely captivating. Designed by Paris-based animators
                <a class="post-link" href="http://www.kuntzeldeygas.com/">Olivier Kuntzel and Florence Deygas</a>, they were able to create a look that suited the ’60s-set story.
