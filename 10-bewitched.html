Then he finds out that Sam is one of a secret society of powerful witches and warlocks and that a twitch of her nose brings magic results. Thoroughly befuddled, Darrin makes her promise never to use her powers. She agrees and tries to settle into being the perfect suburban housewife. Her mother, Endora, however, has a different agenda. She hates that Sam has married a mortal and continually tries to break them up. Sam's other spellbinding friends pop in and out of the Stephens' household as Sam tries (and fails -- most of the time) to live without magic.</a>

                Bewitched’s pilot is in 1964, some would say the peak of mid century design. In the first episode, the hotel that Samantha and Darrin are in for their honeymoon is much more American traditional. However later in the show, we see their living room which is a great example of domestic mid-century design seen in television shows. They did a great job of presenting the era at the time for a (mostly) normal family through its furniture. The couch in their living room is similar to the <a class="post-link" href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/lounge-seating/nelson-daybed/">Nelson Daybed</a> designed by George Nelson in 1950. Although this couch doesn’t have arms, it has a similar sleek body and textured cushions. The living room also features some classic green carpeting and a coffee table extremely similar to <a class="post-link" href="(https://www.pamono.com/mid-century-2-tier-teak-coffee-table-by-richard-hornby-for-heal-s">Richard Hornby’s Teak Coffee Table</a> with its simple structure.
